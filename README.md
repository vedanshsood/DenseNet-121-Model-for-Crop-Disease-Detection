# DenseNet-121 Model for Crop Disease Detection

This repository provides an implementation of a DenseNet-121 model for detecting crop diseases. It leverages transfer learning to achieve high accuracy and includes real-time detection capabilities using a PC camera.

## Features
- **DenseNet-121 Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained DenseNet-121 model adapted for crop disease classification.
- **Real-time Detection**: Includes code for real-time detection using a webcam.
- **Saved Model**: Pre-trained model available in `.h5` format.
- **Test Images**: A sample set of test images is provided in a compressed format.
